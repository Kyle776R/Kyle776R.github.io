Rossi Research Assistant at Kent State University (he/him) About Me I am a doctoral student and research assistant at Kent State University. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. while working on the srcML infrastructure. My primary interests are in software engineering and programming language parsing, although I am working on Pythonic idiom analysis. srcML srcML (Source Markup Language) is an XML representation for source code that preserves all original content. It is lightweight, scalable, and supports various programming languages (e.g., C, C++, C#, Java, and Python). Notably, srcML has its own built-in query language ( srcQL ) and is the foundation for many tools (e.g., stereocode , nameCollector , etc.). Example file example.py : # Adds two numbers, x and y def sum(x, y): return x + y srcML output for example.py : <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?> <unit xmlns=\"http://www.srcML.org/srcML/src\" revision=\"1.0.0\" language=\"Python\" filename=\"example.py\"> <comment type=\"line\"># Adds two numbers, x and y</comment> <function>def <name>sum</name><parameter_list>(<parameter><name>x</name></parameter>, <parameter><name>y</name></parameter>)</parameter_list><block>:<block_content> <return>return <expr><name>x</name> <operator>+</operator> <name>y</name></expr></return> </block_content></block></function></unit> I have primarily contributed to srcML by modifying the existing infrastructure to support the addition of new programming languages (e.g., Python). I am also involved with writing programming language grammars (in XML format) and bug fixing. Using srcML, I have extended existing Pythonic idiom detection.
